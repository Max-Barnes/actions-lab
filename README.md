# actions-lab

Setting up github actions for work. Test #1

Test #2

Test #3 - Looks like its working, _work dir becomes your production directory

Test #4 - reboot workflow working, set up self hosted runner as systemd service and everything should run smoothly. RMU will need its own github account to make this work easiest, but im sure you could get away with a personal one.

The repo used by RMU (if public) can be found at the account github.com/digitalsignage-rmu/kiosk
